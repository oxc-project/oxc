Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Enable `transform-modules-commonjs` conformance tests

## Context

The `transform-modules-commonjs` plugin is listed in `PLUGINS_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`, which causes all its Babel test fixtures to be skipped. The user wants to enable these tests so they show up in the conformance snapshot (as failures initially), providing visibility into what needs to be implemented.

## Changes

### File: `tasks/transform_conformance/src/constants.rs`

1. **Add** `"babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs"` to the `PLUGINS` array (after the ES2015 section, before TypeScript)

2. **Remove** `"transform-modules-commonjs"` from `PLUGINS_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`

### No skip entries needed

All tests should be included — they'll show as failures in the snapshot, which is the intended behavior for tracking progress.

## Verification

```bash
cargo run -p oxc_transform_conformance
```

This will regenerate the snapshot at `tasks/transform_conformance/snapshots/babel.snap.md` with the new CJS test failures included.

I see a lot of output mismatch from tasks/transform_conformance/snapshots/babel.snap.md

implement cjs to esm transform and pass all tests
