Usage: [-c=<./oxlintrc.json>] [PATH]...

Basic Configuration
    -c, --config=<./oxlintrc.json>  Oxlint configuration file (experimental)
                              * only `.json` extension is supported
                              * tries to be compatible with the ESLint v8's format
        --tsconfig=<./tsconfig.json>  TypeScript `tsconfig.json` path for reading path alias and
                              project references for import plugin

Allowing / Denying Multiple Lints
   Accumulate rules and categories from left to right on the command-line.
   For example `-D correctness -A no-debugger` or `-A all -D no-debugger`.
   The categories are:
   * `correctness` - code that is outright wrong or useless (default).
   * `suspicious`  - code that is most likely wrong or useless.
   * `pedantic`    - lints which are rather strict or have occasional false positives.
   * `style`       - code that should be written in a more idiomatic way.
   * `nursery`     - new lints that are still under development.
   * `restriction` - lints which prevent the use of language and library features.
   * `all`         - all the categories listed above except nursery. Does not enable plugins
  automatically.
    -A, --allow=NAME          Allow the rule or category (suppress the lint)
    -W, --warn=NAME           Deny the rule or category (emit a warning)
    -D, --deny=NAME           Deny the rule or category (emit an error)

        --ignore-pattern=PAT  Specify patterns of files to ignore (in addition to those in
