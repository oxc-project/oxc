// User should not schedule more async tasks than there are available CPUs, as it hurts performance,
// but it's a common mistake in async JS code to do exactly that.
//
// That anti-pattern looks like this when applied to Oxc:
//
// ```js
// const asts = await Promise.all(
//   files.map(
//     async (filename) => {
//       const sourceText = await fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8');
//       const ast = await oxc.parseAsync(filename, sourceText);
//       return ast;
//     }
//   )
// );
// ```
//
// In most cases, that'd just result in a bit of degraded performance, and higher memory use because
// of loading sources into memory prematurely.
//
// However, raw transfer uses a 6 GiB buffer for each parsing operation.
// Most of the memory pages in those buffers are never touched, so this does not consume a huge amount
// of physical memory, but it does still consume virtual memory.
//
// If we allowed creating a large number of 6 GiB buffers simultaneously, it would quickly consume
// virtual memory space and risk memory exhaustion. The code above would exhaust all of bottom half
// (heap) of 48-bit virtual memory space if `files.length >= 21_845`. This is not a number which
// is unrealistic in real world code.
//
// To guard against this possibility, we implement a simple queue.
// No more than `os.availableParallelism()` files can be parsed simultaneously, and any further calls to
// `parseAsyncRaw` will be put in a queue, to execute once other tasks complete.
//
// Fallback to `os.cpus().length` on versions of NodeJS prior to v18.14.0, which do not support
// `os.availableParallelism`.

// We keep a cache of buffers for raw transfer, so we can reuse them as much as possible.

// When processing multiple files, it's ideal if can reuse an existing buffer, as it's more likely to
// be warm in CPU cache, it avoids allocations, and it saves work for the garbage collector.
//
// However, we also don't want to keep a load of large buffers around indefinitely using up memory,
// if they're not going to be used again.
//
// We have no knowledge of what pattern over time user may process files in (could be lots in quick
// succession, or more occasionally in a long-running process). So we try to use flexible caching
// strategy which is adaptable to many usage patterns.
//
// We use a 2-tier cache.
// Tier 1 uses strong references, tier 2 uses weak references.
//
// When parsing is complete and the buffer is no longer in use, push it to `buffers` (tier 1 cache).
// Set a timer to clear the cache when no activity for 10 seconds.
//
// When the timer expires, move all the buffers from tier 1 cache into `oldBuffers` (tier 2).
// They are stored there as `WeakRef`s, so the garbage collector is free to reclaim them.
//
// On the next call to `parseSync` or `parseAsync`, promote any buffers in tier 2 cache which were not
// already garbage collected back into tier 1 cache. This is on assumption that parsing one file
// indicates parsing as a whole is an ongoing process, and there will likely be further calls to
// `parseSync` / `parseAsync` in future.
//
// The weak tier 2 cache is because V8 does not necessarily free memory as soon as it's able to be
// freed. We don't want to block it from freeing memory, but if it's not done that yet, there's no
// point creating a new buffer, when one already exists.
