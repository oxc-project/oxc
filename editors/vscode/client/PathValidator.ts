/**
 * Validates the given project given path to ensure it is safe to use.
 *
 * Following checks are performed:
 * Check for path traversal (e.g., using `..` to go up directories).
 * Check for malicious characters or patterns (e.g., `$`, `&`, `;`, `|`).
 * Check if the filename contains `oxc_language_server` to ensure it's the expected binary.
 *
 * The check for malicious characters is not needed, but it's an additional layer of security.
 * When using `shell: true` in `LanguageClient.ServerOptions`, it can be vulnerable to command injection.
 * Even though we are not using `shell: true`, it's a good practice to validate the input.
