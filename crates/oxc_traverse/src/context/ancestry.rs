/// This type MUST NOT be mutable by consumer.

/// to prevent consumer from accessing fields of nodes which traversal has passed through,
/// so as to not violate Rust's aliasing rules.
/// If consumer could alter `stack` in any way, they could break the safety invariants and cause UB.
///
/// We prevent this in 3 ways:
/// 1. `TraverseAncestry`'s `stack` field is private.
/// 2. Public methods of `TraverseAncestry` provide no means for mutating `stack`.
/// 3. Visitors receive a `&mut TraverseCtx`, but cannot overwrite its `ancestry` field because they:
///    a. cannot create a new `TraverseAncestry` - `TraverseAncestry::new` is private.
///    b. cannot obtain an owned `TraverseAncestry` from a `&TraverseAncestry`
///       - `TraverseAncestry` is not `Clone`.
