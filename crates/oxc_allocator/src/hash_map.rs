///

/// when the allocator is dropped, without dropping the individual objects in the arena.
///
/// Therefore, it would produce a memory leak if you allocated [`Drop`] types into the arena
/// which own memory allocations outside the arena.

/// SAFETY: Even though `Bump` is not `Sync`, we can make `HashMap<K, V>` `Sync` if both `K` and `V`
/// are `Sync` because:
///
/// 1. No public methods allow access to the `&Bump` that `HashMap` contains (in `hashbrown::HashMap`),
///    so user cannot illegally obtain 2 `&Bump`s on different threads via `HashMap`.
///
/// 2. All internal methods which access the `&Bump` take a `&mut self`.
///    `&mut HashMap` cannot be transferred across threads, and nor can an owned `HashMap`
///    (`HashMap` is not `Send`).
///    Therefore these methods taking `&mut self` can be sure they're not operating on a `HashMap`
///    which has been moved across threads.
///
/// Note: `HashMap` CANNOT be `Send`, even if `K` and `V` are `Send`, because that would allow 2 `HashMap`s
/// on different threads to both allocate into same arena simultaneously. `Bump` is not thread-safe,
/// and this would be undefined behavior.
///
/// ### Soundness holes
///
/// This is not actually fully sound. There are 2 holes I (@overlookmotel) am aware of:
///
/// 1. `allocator` method, which does allow access to the `&Bump` that `HashMap` contains.
/// 2. `Clone` impl on `hashbrown::HashMap`, which may perform allocations in the arena, given only a
///    `&self` reference.
///
/// [`HashMap::allocator`] prevents accidental access to the underlying method of `hashbrown::HashMap`,
/// and `clone` called on a `&HashMap` clones the `&HashMap` reference, not the `HashMap` itself (harmless).
/// But both can be accessed via explicit `Deref` (`hash_map.deref().allocator()` or `hash_map.deref().clone()`),
/// so we don't have complete soundness.
///
/// To close these holes we need to remove `Deref` and `DerefMut` impls on `HashMap`, and instead add
/// methods to `HashMap` itself which pass on calls to the inner `hashbrown::HashMap`.
///
/// TODO: Fix these holes.
/// TODO: Remove any other methods that currently allow performing allocations with only a `&self` reference.
