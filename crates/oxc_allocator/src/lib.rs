//! # âš“ Oxc Memory Allocator
//!
//! Oxc uses a bump-based memory arena for faster AST allocations. This crate
//! contains an [`Allocator`] for creating such arenas, as well as ports of
//! memory management data types from `std` adapted to use this arena.
//!
//! ## No `Drop`s
//!
//! Objects allocated into Oxc memory arenas are never [`Dropped`](Drop).
//! Memory is released in bulk when the allocator is dropped, without dropping the individual
//! objects in the arena.
//!
//! Therefore, it would produce a memory leak if you allocated [`Drop`] types into the arena
//! which own memory allocations outside the arena.
//!
//! Static checks make this impossible to do. [`Allocator::alloc`], [`Box::new_in`], [`Vec::new_in`],
//! and all other methods which store data in the arena will refuse to compile if called with
//! a [`Drop`] type.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use oxc_allocator::{Allocator, Box};
//!
//! struct Foo {
//!     pub a: i32
//! }
//!
//! impl std::ops::Drop for Foo {
//!     fn drop(&mut self) {}
//! }
//!
//! struct Bar {
//!     v: std::vec::Vec<u8>,
//! }
//!
//! let allocator = Allocator::default();
//!
//! // This will fail to compile because `Foo` implements `Drop`
//! let foo = Box::new_in(Foo { a: 0 }, &allocator);
//! // This will fail to compile because `Bar` contains a `std::vec::Vec`, and it implements `Drop`
//! let bar = Box::new_in(Bar { v: vec![1, 2, 3] }, &allocator);
//! ```
//!
//! Consumers of the [`oxc` umbrella crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc) pass
//! [`Allocator`] references to other tools.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use oxc::{allocator::Allocator, parser::Parser, span::SourceType};
//!
//! let allocator = Allocator::default();
//! let parsed = Parser::new(&allocator, "let x = 1;", SourceType::default());
//! assert!(parsed.errors.is_empty());
//! ```
