//! # âš“ Oxc Memory Allocator
//!
//! Oxc uses a bump-based memory arena for faster AST allocations.
//!
//! This crate contains an [`Allocator`] for creating such arenas, as well as ports of data types
//! from `std` adapted to use this arena:
//!
//! * [`Box`]
//! * [`Vec`]
//! * [`String`]
//! * [`HashMap`]
//!
//! See [`Allocator`] docs for information on efficient use of [`Allocator`].
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * `serialize` - Enables serialization support for [`Box`] and [`Vec`] with `serde` and `oxc_estree`.
//!
//! * `from_raw_parts` - Adds [`Allocator::from_raw_parts`] method.
//!   Usage of this feature is not advisable, and it will be removed as soon as we're able to.
//!
//! * `fixed_size` - Makes [`AllocatorPool`] create large fixed-size allocators, instead of
//!   flexibly-sized ones.
//!   Only supported on 64-bit little-endian platforms at present.
//!   Usage of this feature is not advisable, and it will be removed as soon as we're able to.
//!
//! * `disable_fixed_size` - Disables `fixed_size` feature.
//!   Purpose is to prevent `--all-features` enabling fixed sized allocators.
