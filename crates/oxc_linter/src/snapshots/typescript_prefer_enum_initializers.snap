  help: Using default numerical values for enum members can cause bugs later on if the enum is modified. Instead give "Up" an explicit initializer (for example `= 0` or `= 'Up'`).
  note: TypeScript computes uninitialized enum members as numbers: the first one defaults to `0`, and each following uninitialized member is the previous numeric value plus `1`.
