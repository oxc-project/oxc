    /// Describes how a symbol is being referenced in the AST.
    ///
    /// There are three general categories of references:
    /// 1. Values being referenced as values
    /// 2. Types being referenced as types
    /// 3. Values being used in type contexts
    ///
    /// ## Value as Type
    /// The [`ValueAsType`] flag is a temporary marker for references that need to
    /// resolve to value symbols initially, but will ultimately be treated as type references.
    /// This flag is crucial in scenarios like TypeScript's `typeof` operator.
    ///
    /// For example, in `type T = typeof a`:
    /// 1. The reference to 'a' is initially flagged with [`ValueAsType`].
    /// 2. This ensures that during symbol resolution, 'a' should be a value symbol.
    /// 3. However, the final resolved reference's flags will be treated as a type.
    ///
    /// ## Types
    /// Type references are indicated by [`Type`]. These are used primarily in
    /// type definitions and signatures. Types can never be re-assigned, so
    /// there is no read/write distinction for type references.
    ///
    /// [`Read`]: ReferenceFlags::Read
    /// [`Write`]: ReferenceFlags::Write
    /// [`Type`]: ReferenceFlags::Type
    /// [`ValueAsType`]: ReferenceFlags::ValueAsType
