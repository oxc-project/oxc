# Getting started

Create a `test.js` and run the example `just example prettier` from `crates/oxc_prettier/examples/prettier.rs`, follow the code structure and read the references documented at the top of the files.

# Tasks

- [x] Have the basic infrastructure ready for contribution
- [x] Implement a test runner in Rust which extracts the snapshots and do a comparison over it
- [x] Establish a way to pass all the tests by manually porting code
- [ ] Pass as many tests as possible in https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/main/tests/format/js
