The Oxidation Compiler is currently creating a suite of tools for the JavaScript/TypeScript language, which comprises:

* [Parser](./crates/oxc_parser) - See [docs.rs/oxc_parser](https://docs.rs/oxc_parser)
* [Linter](./crates/oxc_linter) - Work in progress
* Formatter
* Transpiler
* [Minifier](./crates/oxc_minifier) - Draft

## Goals

The primary objectives for this project include:

* Create a *really* fast native program by using the Rust programming language
* Provide the basic building blocks for creating your own tools by having good API designs
* Provide good documentation on learning Rust and compiler techniques

> Performance issues are considered as bugs in this project.

## Contributing

This project is an invitation for you to come and learn Rust with us,
We welcome and appreciate all contributions to this project.

* provide your wisdom in [discussions](https://github.com/Boshen/oxc/discussions)

## Milestone

As of now, Oxc has a fully working parser and a prototype for the linter.

The current objectives are:

* A MVP (Most Viable Product) for the linter.
* Improve the parser for real usage. Areas include:
  * Performance
  * API
  * Pass more conformance tests

## Linter

The linter is fast to the extent that it feels broken.

With a few rules implemented, testing in the [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repo:

```
vscode  main ❯ npx oxidation-compiler@latest lint src
Checked 3479 files in 335ms using 12 cores.
Found 17 errors.
```

And also in a large monorepo:

```
Checked 73660 files in 7415ms using 12 cores.
Found 470 errors.
```

On my Intel i7 6-core, the linter is around 84 times faster than ESLint.
But we'll get slightly slower as we add more features.

See [benchmark](./benchmark/) for details.

### Try it out yourself!

The linter is currently usable and it can potentially catch a few mistakes for you:

```
npx oxidation-compiler@latest lint path
```

All feedbacks are welcome.

## Parser Conformance

The `cargo coverage` command reports the following conformance summary

```
Test262 Summary:
AST Parsed     : 44000/44000 (100.00%)
Positive Passed: 44000/44000 (100.00%)
Negative Passed: 3915/3915 (100.00%)

Babel Summary:
AST Parsed     : 2065/2071 (99.71%)
Positive Passed: 2062/2071 (99.57%)
Negative Passed: 1332/1502 (88.68%)

TypeScript Summary:
TypeScript Summary:
AST Parsed     : 2337/2337 (100.00%)
Positive Passed: 2331/2337 (99.74%)
Negative Passed: 673/2535 (26.55%)
```

Test262 conformance is complete. TypeScript parsing is complete.

Only unstable stage 3 `json-modules` and stage 3 `decorators` tests are skipped.
