## ‚öì Oxc

_/o ä …õks siÀê/_

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Oxc is part of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/)'s vision for a unified, high-performance toolchain for JavaScript. It powers [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) ([Vite]'s future bundler) and enables the next generation of ultra-fast development tools that work seamlessly together.

For more information, check out our website at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs).

<sub>* Oxidation is the chemical process that creates rust</sub>

## Workspace-wide Linting (Experimental)

Oxlint now supports an optional workspace-wide linting mode in the VS Code extension.

When enabled, all lintable files in the workspace are analyzed eagerly (not only the ones you open). This provides:

- Immediate visibility of problems across the entire codebase in the Problems panel
- Automatic incremental re-linting of changed files via LSP file watchers
- Respect for `.gitignore` and oxlint ignore patterns
- High performance through internal parallelization and batching

Enable it via the VS Code setting: `oxc.lint.workspaceMode`.

Notes:
- This feature is currently experimental and disabled by default.
- Designed to scale to large monorepos (thousands of files) while remaining fast.
- Only re-lints changed files after the initial scan to minimize overhead.
- Supports common JS/TS framework file extensions (js, mjs, cjs, jsx, ts, mts, cts, tsx, vue, svelte, astro).

Planned improvements include progress reporting during the initial scan and additional configurability (custom include/exclude globs).

## üèóÔ∏è Design Principles

- **Performance**: Through rigorous performance engineering.
- **Correctness**: Through conformance testing to standards and similar projects.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and sensible configuration.
- **Modular composability**: Use individual components independently or compose them into complete toolchains.

See [documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage) for detailed usage guides for each tool.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### Linter

The production-ready linter catches mistakes for you with sensible defaults and optional configuration:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds:

### Formatter

Fast, opinionated code formatter compatible with [Prettier]:

```bash
npx oxfmt@latest
```

‚Üí [Formatter documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter)

### Parser (Node.js)

The fastest JavaScript/TypeScript parser written in Rust:

```bash
npm install oxc-parser
```

```js
import { parseSync } from 'oxc-parser';
const result = parseSync('const x = 1;');
```

‚Üí [Parser documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/parser)

### Transformer (Node.js)

TypeScript, React, and modern JavaScript transformation:

```bash
npm install oxc-transform
```

```js
import { transform } from 'oxc-transform';
const result = transform('source.tsx', code, { typescript: true });
```

‚Üí [Transformer documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/transformer)

### Minifier (Node.js)

```bash
npm install oxc-minify
```

```js
import { minify } from 'oxc-minify';
const result = minify(code, { mangle: true });
```

‚Üí [Minifier documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/minifier)

### Rust

Individual crates are published for building your own JavaScript tools:

```toml
[dependencies]
oxc = "0.x"
```
