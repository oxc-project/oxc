# Prettier Conformance Test Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

### Branch Comparison

## üö® REGRESSION ALERT

The development branch (`temp/fix-newly-failing-conformance-tests`) has **23 regressions** compared to the main branch:
- **16 JavaScript tests** that were passing in main are now failing
- **7 TypeScript tests** that were passing in main are now failing

## Key Findings

### Development Branch Status
- **JavaScript**: 647 passing out of 699 tests (92.56% pass rate)
- **TypeScript**: 526 passing out of 573 tests (91.80% pass rate)
- **Total Failing**: 52 JavaScript + 47 TypeScript = **99 total failures**

### Main Branch Baseline
- **JavaScript**: 663 passing out of 699 tests (94.85% pass rate)
- **TypeScript**: 533 passing out of 573 tests (93.02% pass rate)
- **Total Failing**: 36 JavaScript + 40 TypeScript = **76 total failures**

### Performance Degradation
The development branch shows a **-2.29%** JavaScript and **-1.22%** TypeScript performance degradation compared to main.

## Critical Action Items

### Priority 1: Fix Regressions (BLOCKING)
**These must be fixed before proceeding:**

1. **Identify the 16 JavaScript test regressions**
   - Run with `--filter` to isolate failing tests
   - Check for recent AST or formatter changes that could cause failures

2. **Identify the 7 TypeScript test regressions**
   - Focus on TypeScript-specific syntax handling
   - Review any changes to TypeScript node formatting

### Priority 2: Root Cause Analysis
1. Review recent commits on the development branch
2. Check for any changes to:
   - AST node definitions
   - Formatter logic
   - Parser behavior
   - Print width or formatting options handling

### Priority 3: Recovery Plan
1. Consider reverting recent changes if regressions cannot be quickly fixed
2. Run tests with verbose output to identify exact failure points
3. Use `git diff main` to review all changes in formatter-related files

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action Required**: The branch name suggests you were working on fixing conformance tests, but instead we have MORE failing tests. This needs immediate attention.

2. **Run Detailed Analysis**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p oxc_prettier_conformance -- --filter <specific_test>
   ```

3. **Compare Snapshots**: Check if snapshot files were updated incorrectly

4. **Bisect if Necessary**: If the regression source is unclear, use git bisect between main and current branch

## Conclusion

‚ùå **The development branch is NOT ready for merge** due to 23 test regressions.

The irony is not lost that a branch named "fix-newly-failing-conformance-tests" has actually introduced MORE failing tests. This suggests either:
1. The fixes attempted have broken other tests
2. There were merge conflicts or rebase issues
3. Dependencies or test infrastructure has changed

**Recommendation**: Focus exclusively on bringing the pass rates back to at least main branch levels before any other work.
