Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Fix trailing expression in object rest spread assignment (#7389 issue 1)

## Context

The object rest spread transformer produces suboptimal output for destructuring assignments like `({ a2, ...b2 } = c2)`. The trailing reference `_c` in the sequence expression is unnecessary when the expression result isn't used.

## Problem

Current output:
```js
_c = c2, {a2} = _c, b2 = babelHelpers.objectWithoutProperties(_c, ["a2"]), _c;
//                                                                          ^^ unnecessary
```

The trailing `_c` is only needed when the expression's value is consumed (e.g., `console.log(({ a, ...b } = c))`).

## Fix

**File**: `crates/oxc_transformer/src/es2018/object_rest_spread.rs` (lines 278-281)

At line 278, there's already a TODO. Before adding the trailing reference on line 281, check if the immediate parent context is an `ExpressionStatement`. The code already iterates ancestors at line 225 to find the `ExpressionStatementExpression` ancestor — we can check if this is the direct parent of the assignment expression (i.e., the assignment is the top-level expression in the statement, not nested in another expression).

Specifically: check `ctx.ancestors()` — if the first ancestor is `ExpressionStatementExpression`, skip the trailing reference. If the first ancestor is something else (e.g., `CallExpressionArguments`, `SequenceExpressionExpressions`), keep it.

## Test update

Update `tasks/transform_conformance/overrides/babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread/test/fixtures/object-rest/assignment-expression/output.js`:

Line 3 changes from:
```js
_c = c2, {a2} = _c, b2 = babelHelpers.objectWithoutProperties(_c, ["a2"]), _c;
```
To:
```js
_c = c2, {a2} = _c, b2 = babelHelpers.objectWithoutProperties(_c, ["a2"]);
```

## Verification

```bash
cargo test -p oxc_transformer
cargo run -p oxc_transform_conformance
just lint
```
